DESCRIPTION

Implement infix Boolean equivalence and implication operators.

The equivalence operator evaluates true if its operands are both true or
both false. Otherwise it evaluates false. It comes in two forms: '(==)'
has the same precedence as '||', and 'eqv' has the same precedence as
'or'. A wrapper function, 'equivalent()', is also provided. 

The implication operator evaluates true if its left operand is false or
its right operand is true. Otherwise it evaluates false. It comes in two
forms: '==>>' has the same precedence as '||', and 'imp' has the same
precedence as 'or'. A wrapper function, 'implies()', is also provided.

If you do not like the spelling of these operators, you can rename them
on import by following the name of the operator or wrapper function with
a hash reference. The value of key '-as' in this hash specifies the name
registered in your name space. For example:

 use utf8;
 ...
 use Syntax::Operator::Eqv '(==)', { -as => '≍' };
 ...
 say $x ≍ $y ? 'equivalent' : 'not equivalent';

The '≍' is "\N{EQUIVALENT TO}", a.k.a. "\N{U+224D}".

The wrapper functions can be used as far back as Perl v5.14. The infix
operators require Perl v5.38.

These operators first came to my attention in Algol 60.
