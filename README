DESCRIPTION

Implement infix Boolean equivalence and implication operators.

The equivalence operator evaluates true if its operands are both true or
both false. Otherwise it evaluates false. It comes in two forms: '(==)'
has the same precedence as '||', and 'eqv' has the same precedence as
'or'. A wrapper function, 'equivalent()', is also provided. 

The implication operator evaluates true if its left operand is false or
its right operand is true. Otherwise it evaluates false. It comes in two
forms: '==>>' has the same precedence as '||', and 'imp' has the same
precedence as 'or'. A wrapper function, 'implies()', is also provided.

If you do not like the spelling of these operators, you can rename them
on import by following the name of the operator or wrapper function with
a hash reference. The value of key '-as' in this hash specifies the name
registered in your name space. For example:

 use utf8;
 ...
 use Syntax::Operator::Eqv '(==)', { -as => '≍' };
 ...
 say $x ≍ $y ? 'equivalent' : 'not equivalent';

The '≍' is "\N{EQUIVALENT TO}", a.k.a. "\N{U+224D}".

The wrapper functions can be used as far back as Perl v5.14. The infix
operators require Perl v5.38.

These operators first came to my attention in Algol 60.

INSTALLATION

This module is best installed using your favorite CPAN client: cpan,
cpanp, or cpanm. ActivePerl users can try their ppm.

Failing that, you can use one of the two usual incantations:

    gunzip Syntax-Operator-Eqv-9.999.tar.gz
    tar -xf Syntax-Operator-Eqv-9.999.tar
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

or

    gunzip Syntax-Operator-Eqv-9.999.tar.gz
    tar -xf Syntax-Operator-Eqv-9.999.tar
    perl Build.PL
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install

You should substitute the appropriate program name for 'make', eg nmake
(typically) under MSWin32, or mms or mmk under VMS. See
ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/nmake15.exe for a copy of
nmake for MSWin32 if you need it.
